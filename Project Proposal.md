# **Rebound - Give Clothes a Second Life.**

## **Project Overview**  
Rebound is an innovative platform designed to provide shared access to personal wardrobes. By enabling users to donate or sell clothes they no longer need, the platform helps reduce clothing waste, support underprivileged communities, and minimize the environmental impact of the fashion industry.

## **1. Problem Statement**  
### **Clothing Waste and Accessibility**  
The fashion industry is one of the largest contributors to global pollution, with **92 million tons of textile waste** produced annually. Many individuals frequently dispose of clothes that could still be used, exacerbating environmental concerns.  

At the same time, there are underprivileged communities and individuals who lack access to affordable clothing. This disparity highlights the need for a solution that bridges the gap between those with excess clothes and those in need.  

**Key Issues We Address:**  
1. **Clothing Accessibility**: Helping people who cannot afford new clothes gain access to quality second-hand items.  
2. **Environmental Impact**: Reducing clothing waste and promoting a culture of sustainability.  
3. **Social Connection**: Building a community where people can share, donate, and sell clothes in a collaborative space.

## **2. Proposed Solution**  
Rebound provides a seamless platform for individuals to **upload, share, donate, and sell clothing** they no longer use. It combines the principles of circular economy and social good by:  
1. Allowing users to **upload pictures** of clothes with descriptions.  
2. Enabling others to browse and filter available items based on their needs.  
3. Offering a built-in **chat system** to arrange donations or purchases.  

The ultimate goal is to **extend the lifecycle of clothes**, reduce waste, and support those in need, while fostering a sustainable and socially responsible fashion ecosystem.
